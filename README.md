The Server Side Web Assignment for my BSc Ordinary Degree in Digital Technologies and Design in Applications Development

Assignment Breif:

Build a web service in PHP. While the data that you will expose can be anything of your choosing, it is suggested that your output matches the format expected by your mobile app from the mobile web applications module, so that you can hook both applications together if you wish, however this is not a requirement!

Your application will have the following features:

1. An Object Oriented design pattern, using at least two classes which work
together. 

2. A backend database from which your output will be produced.

3. A Web API: Your service will expose a (very simple) RESTful API which can be called over HTTP (GET only).

4. At least two API endpoints, i.e. two types of return object.

5. JSON output: your service does not need to return XML data, JSON will be sufficient. You will only output JSON - there is no HMTL element to this assignment.

Requirements:

The outputted JSON must be well formed - i.e. syntactically correct.

Your endpoint naming conforms to best practices (singular / plural where appropriate).

Your PHP code is fully OO.

Your PHP code is clear, readable and contains adequate comments
(PEAR standards - or some similar, class headers, etc.).

You class, method and variable naming is appropriate.
There is a portion of independent study required for this
assignment with regard to your API structure.
